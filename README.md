## SimplexityLogParse

The term Simplexity comes from Jeffrey Kluger's book of the same name that tries to explain why simple things become complex and how complex things can be made simple.

This log parse was an interview question I was asked at one point and I went overboard with structure and complicated the hell out of it.  In fact the ask could be handled in a single terminal command, but python?!?

Repo contains an example file for parsing, as long as it is ran in the same file as the .py it will just output the results.
